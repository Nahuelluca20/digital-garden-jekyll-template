Hello, I'm Nahuel! ðŸ‘‹ I'm a passionate Frontend Developer dedicated to crafting captivating web experiences. My expertise lies in leveraging cutting-edge technologies, specializing in development with React, Next.js and Remix.

I wield Tailwind CSS to style my creations with both elegance and efficiency. Beyond that, I love working with modern databases, and my current go-to is Supabase, providing an unparalleled development experience.

In my journey to build robust applications, I rely on Prisma for efficient and secure data access layer management. For authentication, Clerk is my trusted ally, ensuring a secure and seamless login experience for users.
